Barbera
The red Barbera grape is grown throughout Italy, but the Piedmont region, at the foot of the Alps, produces the most celebrated Barbera wines, including Barbera d’Alba and Barbera d’Asti. Traditionally, Barbera exhibits sour cherry and other red fruit flavors, light tannins, high acidity and medium body. When aged in oak, Barbera gains body and complexity.
Classic Barbera food pairings include Italian cuisine, especially beef dishes and tomato-based sauces.
