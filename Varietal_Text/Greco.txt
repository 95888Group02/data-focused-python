Greco
This late-ripening variety from Campania flaunts an invigorating mineral charactermore so than its other regional white grape compatriots, Fiano and Falanghina. Bursting with fresh citrus, stone fruit, herb and spice, Greco di Tufo wines are dark lemon or gold in color but as that might suggest, arent particularly heavy on the palate. The wines are medium- to full-bodied and have a relatively high acidity. The name Tufo comes from the soft, volcanic rock found all over in the subsoil of the region where Greco thrives.
