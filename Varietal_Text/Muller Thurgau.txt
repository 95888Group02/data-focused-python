Muller Thurgau
M端ller-Thurgau is a white grape variety created by Hermann M端ller in the Swiss Canton of Thurgau in 1882. He crossed Riesling with the table grape, Madeleine Royale, with the goal of making a delightful drinking wine from an easier-to-grow vine than Riesling. When done right, M端ller-Thurgau is full-bodied with floral aromatics. It has a refreshing, ripe, peach character that balances a crunchy and crisp quality. M端ller-Thurgau makes white wine in Germany, Austria, Northern Italy, Hungary, England, Australia, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, New Zealand, the United States and Japan. While some of its best examples actually come from the Alto Adige region of Italy, it is still the second most widely planted white grape in Germany second to Riesling. Worldwide, it is one of the most widely planted of the new breeds created since the 19th century.
