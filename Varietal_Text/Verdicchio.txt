Verdicchio
One of central Italys classic white grapes, Verdicchio thrives in the Marche region; its best versions come from two distinct appellations. Verdicchio dei Castelli di Jesi, to the west of Ancona, is only 20 miles from the Adriatic Sea and the smaller, Verdicchio di Matelica, is inland and at a higher elevation. Castelli di Jesi is Marches largest DOC but its best wines come from its hillside vineyards. The best Verdicchio boast fresh citrus fruit with a mineral lift, a sturdy finish and can age for a decade. Recent genetic discoveries have proven that the Verdicchio grape is identical to Trebbiano di Soave, Trebbiano di Lugana and Trebbiano Veltenesi.
