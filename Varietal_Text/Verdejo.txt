Verdejo
Light-bodied but captivating with flavors of citrus blossom, melon, white peach and fennel, Verdejo is native to Rueda, Spain, and is growing in popularity. If youÂ’re used to drinking Sauvignon blanc or Pinot grigio, this is the wine for you! Contrary to what some may think, it is actually not related to the Portugese variety with a very similar name, Verdelho. In fact, DNA profiling suggests it is most likely a sibling of Godello, a variety native to northwest Spain. Enjoy this little charmer with a variety of dishes like fish tacos, Thai food, papaya salad or even lemon-spritzed asparagus and steamed artichokes.
