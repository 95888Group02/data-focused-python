Junmai-Daiginjo
Saké with the highest milling requirement at 50%, so that 50% of each grain of rice remains unmilled, is called Junmai-Daiginjo. It is, just like Junmai and Junmai-Ginjo, made up solely of water, koji mold, yeast and rice. The categories of saké are established not by rice variety, but by polishing or milling percentages; this category is the highest.
