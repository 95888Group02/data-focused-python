Grillo
Full-bodied and delicately aromatic, Grillo is one of Sicilys most valued white grape varieties. While it is an important ingredient in Marsala, it also makes a delicious dry white wine on its own. It is a natural cross of Sicilys indigenous Catarratto with Muscat of Alexandria and typically grows in bush vines. Its best versions are plentiful in fruit such as tropical fruits, white peach or bitter citrus and express aromas of elderflower, mint, or fresh herbs.
