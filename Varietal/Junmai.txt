Junmai
Sake with the lowest milling requirement at no less than 30% milled, so that 70% of each rice grain remains, is simply called Junmai. It is made of water, koji mold, yeast and rice. The categories of saké are established not by rice variety, but by their polishing or milling percentages. Junmai is also brewed in the absence of added alcohol. Some brewers, in search of other flavors, aromas and textures, will add a small amount of distilled alcohol during the brewing process. But the alcohol in any saké labeled Junmai will come purely from fermentation.
